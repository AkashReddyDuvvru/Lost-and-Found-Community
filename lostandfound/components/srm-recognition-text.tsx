        We are proud to share that our Lost and Found website has been officially selected by SRM Institute of Science
        and Technology and is now tied up with the institution as a recognized student-driven initiative.

      <p className="mb-4">
        This project was developed as a team by Dhanush, Mohit, and Akash Reddy, with the shared goal of creating a
        reliable and efficient platform to help students and faculty recover lost items across the campus.

        This recognition from SRM is a major milestone for us, and we look forward to making a meaningful impact within
        the university community.
